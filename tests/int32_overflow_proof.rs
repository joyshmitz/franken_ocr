//! Doctrine #6 PROOF OBLIGATION — int8 i32-accumulation overflow safety.
//!
//! From `AGENTS.md` doctrine #6 (and plan §5.4):
//!
//! > **int8 i32-accumulation overflow is a proof obligation, not an
//! > assumption.** The real worst case here is the dense layer-0 `down_proj`
//! > at **K = 6848** (U8S8 ≤ ~221.7M); it fits i32 but must be proven by a
//! > unit test at worst-case K on every arch. Do NOT inherit frankensearch's
//! > `k≤1536` bound.
//!
//! This file is the *test*, not a bench. It is **self-contained on purpose**:
//! it carries its own reference scalar int8 matmul with an explicit `i32`
//! accumulator and an independent `i64` oracle, so the proof holds even before
//! any real int8/int4 GEMM kernel exists in the tree (those land in Phase 2-4).
//! It references **no** crate internals — `i32` is `i32` regardless of which
//! kernel module eventually fills the slot.
//!
//! ## Why two accumulation schemes
//!
//! ONNX `MatMulInteger` / `DynamicQuantizeLinear` (which our
//! `linear_int8_dynamic` mirrors) and the SDOT/VNNI/SMMLA intrinsics each have
//! a defined operand domain:
//!
//! * **S8S8** — both operands signed int8 in `[-128, 127]`. The element product
//!   whose *magnitude* is largest is `(-128) * (-128) = +16384`, but the
//!   adversary that maximizes a single-sign running sum (no cancellation) uses
//!   `127 * 127 = 16129` on every term, because `-128` cannot be reached on
//!   both operands simultaneously without sign flips that would cancel. The
//!   strict worst case for a monotone accumulator is therefore
//!   `K * 127 * 127`. (We *also* assert the `-128 * -128` all-positive variant
//!   below, which is even larger per-term but still bounded — and we show it
//!   too fits, so the proof is conservative either way.)
//! * **U8S8** — activations are unsigned `u8` in `[0, 255]` (the
//!   `DynamicQuantizeLinear` asymmetric activation path) times signed `i8`
//!   weights in `[-128, 127]`. The worst monotone sum is `K * 255 * 127`.
//!
//! ## Arch-generality
//!
//! The proof is **arch-independent**: the accumulator is a 32-bit two's
//! complement integer on every target, so the bound `value < i32::MAX` is the
//! same for scalar, NEON SDOT, AVX-VNNI, and SMMLA/i8mm. BUT each SIMD kernel,
//! *when it lands*, must re-run this proof against **its own** accumulator
//! width and lane-reduction order (e.g. SMMLA accumulates 8 int8 MACs per
//! 32-bit lane before any horizontal add; VNNI does 4). See the clearly
//! labeled `arch_kernel_reproof_slots` test below for the scaffolded slots.

// ── Worst-case-K table for the *real* model ─────────────────────────────────
//
// These are the contraction lengths `K` that actually occur in the quantized
// decoder GEMMs. 6848 is the dense layer-0 `down_proj` and is the global worst
// case. The frankensearch prior art bounded K at 1536 and would have *rejected*
// 6848 — we explicitly do NOT inherit that bound (see
// `down_proj_6848_specifically_breaks_frankensearch_1536_bound`).
//
// `note` documents where each K comes from so a future reader can map a failing
// row back to a model tensor.

/// channels) and M (number of rows). This test runs a small `[M, K] x [K, N]`
