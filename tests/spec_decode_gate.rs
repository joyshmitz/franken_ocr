//! bd-1azu.36 (LINEAR half) — speculative-decode single-stream GATE hardening:
//! the dispatch-guard surface that keeps `FOCR_SPEC_DECODE` from engaging
//! anywhere outside its proven regime.
//!
//! TREE-verify clauses (per-node logits parity vs the sequential root-to-node
//! path, longest-path accept on branching drafts, the `FOCR_SPEC_TREE_W=1`
//! collapse) are PARKED behind bd-1azu.34 (tree verification) and intentionally
//! absent from this file.
//!
//! The bead's LINEAR gate splits three ways (visibility forces the split —
//! `native_engine::spec` is `pub(crate)`, and an integration test sees only the
//! public API, exactly like `tests/spec_verify_forward_parity.rs`, which rebuilds
//! the verify forward from PUBLIC kernels rather than touching `spec::`):
//!
//! 1. **Fault injection** (drafter is UNTRUSTED input: garbage / oversized /
//!    forged-EOS / empty drafts never change the accepted stream) needs the
//!    `pub(crate)` seams `spec::{accept_longest, resolve_round}`, so it lives
//!    in-crate: `src/native_engine/sampler.rs::spec_gate_fault_injection`
//!    (`spec.rs` itself is owner-frozen this wave; the sampler is the chooser
//!    the verifier reuses, the nearest editable seam).
//! 2. **Dispatch-guard non-engagement** (this file): `FOCR_SPEC_DECODE` may only
//!    arm the spec loop when the decode params are EXACTLY the frozen
//!    single-image ban (`no_repeat_ngram_size == 35`, `ngram_window == 128`) the
//!    verifier's chooser hardwires. The guard's params half is the public
//!    [`DecodeParams::matches_frozen_spec_ban`]; the tests below pin the frozen
//!    constants and prove every override shape (`--no-repeat-ngram 20`,
//!    `--ngram-window 1024`, multi-image, disabled blocker) fails it. The live
//!    dispatch in `OcrModel::generate_cached_i8` CALLS this same predicate
//!    (adopted in `src/native_engine/mod.rs`), so guard and gate cannot drift.
//! 3. **Model-gated ON-vs-OFF byte identity** is `scripts/spec_gate_e2e.sh`:
//!    `FOCR_SPEC_DECODE` is a presence kill-switch read ONCE into a process-wide
//!    `OnceLock`, and edition-2024 `set_var` is `unsafe` (this crate denies
//!    unsafe), so an in-process env flip is impossible — the script drives TWO
//!    `focr` processes (env removed vs `=1`) over real pages and sha256-compares
//!    stdout, the same two-process A/B discipline as the `FOCR_BATCH_VISION`
//!    on/off parity runs. Default-OFF ("unset never engages") is likewise a
//!    process-level property and is exercised there, not here.
