# franken_ocr — Negative-Evidence Ledger

This ledger records optimization attempts and design levers that **failed,
regressed, were neutral, or could not be measured head-to-head**. It exists to
prevent stale optimism from being reused as proof, and to stop the swarm from
re-attempting a lever that has already been shown not to pay.

**A `WIN` only counts with a head-to-head MEASURED ratio against a real
reference and a correctness proof.** A bit-exact local A/B that has not cleared
the strict current-tree and reference gates is a `PROVISIONAL_LOCAL_WIN`, not a
`WIN`, and remains in this ledger rather than `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`. Do not retry
a rejected lever unless its explicit retry condition is satisfied.

This is an **artifact-graph ledger** (plan §8.4), not prose: every entry carries
the FrankenSuite artifact-graph fields so each claim is reproducible and traceable
to the exact model version it was measured against.

## Canonical provenance source (the truth pack)

Every entry's provenance fields resolve against the **Phase −1 truth pack**, the
single immutable anchor for "which model, which sources, which numbers":

- **Model source commit:** Hugging Face `baidu/Unlimited-OCR`
  **`3a7f4dbbbffcc6f9282712c5b0d7cc31b3812da5`** (GitHub
  `7e98affeacba24e95562fbaa234ddb89b856874a`), verified 2026-06-25 via
  `git ls-remote` — see `docs/truth-pack/PINNED_SOURCES.md`.
- **Source / fixture hashes:** the SHA-256 of every load-bearing source
  (`config.json`, `modeling_unlimitedocr.py`, `modeling_deepseekv2.py`,
  `deepencoder.py`, `tokenizer.json`, …) is recorded in
  **`docs/truth-pack/SOURCE_HASHES.md`**. The `model source commit + fixture hash`
  field of every entry below cites `(file_sha256, line range)` against that table;
  the **weights fixture hash** is the SHA-256 of `model-00001-of-000001.safetensors`
  (recorded in `SOURCE_HASHES.md` once fetched out-of-band) plus the `.focrq`
  conversion hash for the precision actually measured.
- **Runtime pin:** the reference oracle stack is `torch==2.10.0`,
  `transformers==4.57.1`, `Pillow==12.1.1` (`PINNED_SOURCES.md`); a number measured
  against any other stack is **not comparable** and does not belong here.

If `SOURCE_HASHES.md` ever fails to verify, the upstream model moved: STOP, re-pin
(`PINNED_SOURCES.md`), and re-confirm every entry whose provenance points at the
old commit. A franken_ocr entry without a resolvable truth-pack provenance is
**incomplete and may not be cited as evidence**.

## Per-entry schema

Every entry records (the frankentorch format **plus** the artifact-graph fields):

```
date | WIN / PROVISIONAL_LOCAL_WIN / NEGATIVE(reverted) / NEGATIVE(retained-for-proof) | lever (what was tried, where)
  claim_id / evidence_id                         # artifact-graph IDs (claim under test → evidence dir)

                                                  #   from SOURCE_HASHES.md, plus .focrq/weights hash

                                                  #   x86_64+avx512vnni) — not the host's max
  exact command + env                            # the literal gauntlet invocation + FOCR_*/OMP_NUM_THREADS/RAYON_* set
  fallback / kill-switch state                   # which path was active: FOCR_INT8_ATTN / FOCR_INT8_LMHEAD /
                                                  #   mimalloc feature / int4-group on|off — proves what ran
  measured before -> after vs reference (ratio)   # real numbers or "blocked: <why>" (ratio = ref_time / focr_time)
  bit-exact correctness proof:                     # test name + result, or the precision contract (ULP/CER bound)
  disposition: KEEP / REVERT
  do-not-retry: "do not retry X unless Y"          # the explicit retry condition
  per-lever tally: W / L / N                        # wins / losses / neutral across attempts
  agent                                             # who ran it
  evidence dir: artifacts/perf/<bead>/             # paired baseline/after gauntlet logs + SHA-256 manifest
```

`PROVISIONAL_LOCAL_WIN` means the implementation survived its local A/B and
correctness gate but still lacks strict current-tree/reference qualification.
`NEGATIVE(retained-for-proof)` means a non-winning path remains available only
for portability or parity diagnostics. A lever that fails its measurement bar
is **REVERTED** unless one of those explicit classifications applies. The
`per-lever tally` accumulates across attempts so a thrice-failed idea is visibly
dead. The **evidence dir** `artifacts/perf/<bead>/` holds the paired baseline/after
gauntlet logs and their SHA-256 manifest — the `evidence_id` points at it, so the
ledger row and the raw artifacts are graph-linked.

**Provenance scope of the inherited priors below.** The `NE-INH-*` entries are
carried over from `frankensearch` / `frankentorch` and were measured on **those**
models, *not* on Unlimited-OCR at `3a7f4db…`. Their provenance field is therefore
`inherited (pre-truth-pack)` by construction: they are **priors to re-confirm on
this model's exact shapes**, never franken_ocr evidence. The first real
franken_ocr entry — and every one after — MUST carry full truth-pack provenance.

## Known negative results inherited from sibling projects

These are **not** franken_ocr measurements. They are carried over from
`frankensearch` / `frankentorch` because franken_ocr will hit the identical
kernel-design decisions, and re-litigating them would waste swarm time. Treat
them as priors, then re-confirm on *this* model's exact shapes before relying on
them.

### NE-INH-1 — naive hand-written wide-SIMD int8 dot was ~5× SLOWER than LLVM autovectorization

- **lever:** replace a scalar / autovectorized int8 dot-product inner loop with a
  hand-written wide-SIMD (manually unrolled vector-width) implementation.
- **measured (frankensearch / frankentorch):** the hand-rolled wide-SIMD int8 dot
  ran **~5× SLOWER** than simply letting LLVM autovectorize the straightforward
  scalar loop. The compiler's autovectorizer already produced better code than
  the naive intrinsics path.
- **disposition:** REVERT (never landed as the default).
- **do-not-retry:** do **not** retry naive, manually-vectorized wide-SIMD over a
  clean autovectorizable scalar int8 dot **unless** the kernel is a *tiled*
  GEMM using the dedicated dot-product instructions (NEON `SDOT`, i8mm `SMMLA`,
  AVX-512-VNNI `VPDPBUSD`, AMX) with register-blocking and accumulator tiling —
  i.e. a fundamentally different kernel shape, not a wider scalar loop. A flat
  wide-SIMD dot is a known dead end.
- **provenance:** `inherited (pre-truth-pack)` — measured on frankensearch/
  frankentorch, NOT on Unlimited-OCR `3a7f4db…`; a prior to re-confirm on this
  model's exact GEMM shapes, not franken_ocr evidence.
- **per-lever tally:** W 0 / L 1 / N 0 (inherited)
- **agent:** inherited (frankensearch / frankentorch)

### NE-INH-2 — frankentorch's SDOT/VNNI int8 dot is still ~1.5–2.4× behind ONNX/MLAS

- **lever:** frankentorch's current int8 dot-product path using `SDOT` (aarch64)
  and VNNI (x86) for matmul.
- **measured (frankentorch):** even with the dedicated dot-product instructions,
  the int8 matmul path remains **~1.5–2.4× behind ONNX Runtime / MLAS** on CPU.
  The gap is real and persistent.
- **diagnosis:** the missing piece is a **model-specific tiled `SMMLA`/`VNNI`
  GEMM** with proper register blocking, packed/pre-transposed weights, and
  accumulator tiling — i.e. the kernel franken_ocr's whole thesis is built on.
  This is the **unbuilt fix**, not a refutation of the approach. Closing this gap
  on Unlimited-OCR's fixed GEMM shapes is the central technical bet.
- **disposition:** N/A — this is the gap franken_ocr exists to close, recorded so
  nobody declares victory on the un-tiled `SDOT`/`VNNI` path or mistakes the
  current frankentorch number for the ceiling.
- **do-not-retry:** do **not** claim a CPU int8 GEMM win **unless** it is measured
  against ONNX/MLAS or the Phase -1 proven CPU baseline on this model's actual shapes
  with the tiled GEMM in place — the un-tiled dot path is already known to lose.
- **provenance:** `inherited (pre-truth-pack)` — frankentorch measurement; the gap
  it names is the one franken_ocr exists to close on Unlimited-OCR `3a7f4db…`'s
  fixed GEMM shapes (`SOURCE_HASHES.md`: `config.json`, `model.safetensors.index.json`).
- **per-lever tally:** W 0 / L 1 / N 0 (inherited; the tiled-GEMM fix is unbuilt)
- **agent:** inherited (frankentorch)

### NE-INH-3 — un-blocked tiled SMMLA was SLOWER than SDOT (load-bound)

- **lever:** a tiled `SMMLA` (i8mm) int8 GEMM with 2× the MAC density of `SDOT`,
  but WITHOUT register/cache blocking.
- **measured (frankensearch/frankentorch, M4):** **19 / 41 / 77 ms** vs SDOT's
  14.8 / 34 / 64 — a **regression**, despite double the MAC throughput, because the
  kernel re-loads the activation for every weight pair (≈**2 loads : 1 SMMLA**) and
  is therefore **load-bound, not compute-bound**. Extra MAC throughput is wasted
  when you are memory-bound.
- **disposition:** REVERT.
- **do-not-retry:** do **not** add a wider/denser matmul instruction (SMMLA, AMX)
  **unless** the micro-kernel already has **register/cache blocking with
  compute:load ≥ 2:1 and offline-pre-packed weights**. The instruction is not the
  lever; the blocking is.
- **provenance:** `inherited (pre-truth-pack)` — frankensearch/frankentorch on M4;
  re-confirm against Unlimited-OCR `3a7f4db…`'s `down_proj` (K=6848) before relying
  on it (the load-bound regime depends on this model's exact tile shapes).
- **per-lever tally:** W 0 / L 1 / N 0 (inherited)
- **agent:** inherited (frankensearch/frankentorch)

### NE-INH-4 — AMX-f32 (Accelerate) does NOT beat ONNX-int8

- **lever:** route the matmuls through Apple's AMX coprocessor in **f32** (via
  Accelerate/numpy) as a "Mac finisher".
- **measured (M4):** ~**11 / 28 / 77 ms** f32 — does not beat ONNX-int8
  (7.6/14.5/41.4), because f32 streams **4× the bytes** of int8 on these
  **memory-bound** sizes, and the element-wise ops (softmax/GELU/transpose) are not
  on AMX anyway.
- **disposition:** REVERT (not the easy finisher).
- **do-not-retry:** do **not** chase AMX **unless** it is **int8** (low bandwidth),
  applied to **compute-bound prefill** (not memory-bound decode), AND the FFI cost
  of Accelerate/BNNS is accepted as an **opt-in feature** (the directly-programmable
  Mac int8 path is NEON SMMLA/SDOT, no FFI).
- **provenance:** `inherited (pre-truth-pack)` — M4 Accelerate/AMX-f32 vs ONNX-int8;
  a memory-bandwidth prior, re-confirm on this model's prefill shapes before any
  AMX experiment lands as a franken_ocr lever.
- **per-lever tally:** W 0 / L 1 / N 0 (inherited)
- **agent:** inherited (frankensearch/frankentorch)

### NE-INH-5 — naive hand-written "fused tape-free forward" regressed 3–10× (the most clarifying failure)

- **lever:** delete the per-op framework tape/dispatch overhead by hand-writing a
  single fused forward — BUT with **naive scalar-f32 attention / softmax /
  LayerNorm** replacing the library's SIMD/parallel kernels.
- **measured (frankensearch, M4):** **38 / 194 / 580 ms** — a **3–10× regression**
  (seq512 was 10× the kernel version). This **disproved the "the gap is all
  framework overhead" theory**: the real gap to ONNX is **kernels below peak**
  (SDOT-not-SMMLA linears, f32-not-int8 attention), not per-op tape cost.
- **disposition:** REVERT.
- **do-not-retry:** the fused, tape-free, zero-per-op-allocation forward is the
  RIGHT architecture (franken_ocr is built that way), but **every fused op must
  stay at peak** (SIMD + parallel + int8/int4). Do **not** trade a good library
  kernel for a naive hand-written one — ever. Measure framework-tax savings only
  with at-peak ops on both sides.
- **lesson for franken_ocr:** out-SPECIALIZE ONNX (fused single-model forward) AND
  keep every op at peak; both are required, neither alone wins.
- **provenance:** `inherited (pre-truth-pack)` — frankensearch M4 seq{128/256/512};
  the architectural lesson (fused forward with at-peak ops) is adopted by
  franken_ocr, but the regression numbers are NOT this model's — the first
  franken_ocr fused-forward measurement carries truth-pack provenance.
- **per-lever tally:** W 0 / L 1 / N 0 (inherited)
- **agent:** inherited (frankensearch)

## franken_ocr measurements

No `PERF_LEDGER.md` head-to-head row exists yet: there is still no certified
Phase -1 CPU-reference ratio for this path. The entries below are local,
synthetic before/after microbenches that retire or keep one narrow loop lever
and preserve the raw artifact bundles for gauntlet follow-up; they are not G2
claims.

2026-07-07 | NEGATIVE(reverted) | row-tiled SAM global-attention score matrix (bd-av64.10, commits c5e535a+8bd4037 reverted)

  exact command + env: interleaved same-regime pairs, FOCR_SAM_TILE=0 (untiled) vs =128, FOCR_TIMING=1 focr ocr page_0009.png; 4 pairs
  fallback / kill-switch state: FOCR_SAM_TILE measurement knob (removed with the revert)
  measured before -> after vs reference:
    HYPOTHESIS: the [4096,4096] per-head score matrix (64 MB) makes four DRAM round-trips (GEMM-write, bias, softmax, GEMM-read);
    a [128,4096] row tile stays cache-resident through all four stages -> save the traffic.
    BYTE-IDENTITY: PROVEN — tiled outputs byte-identical on BOTH real models (unlimited page + GOT sample), i.e. the ft sgemm
    per-element K-reduction order is M-invariant. The restructuring was numerically pure; it just wasn't faster:
    UNTILED WINS ALL 4 PAIRS: sam.forward 3.62/3.62/3.74/3.71 s untiled vs 3.76/3.84/3.86/3.76 s tiled (~+3% regression tiled).
    ROOT CAUSE: tiling turns 2 large GEMMs/head into 64 small dispatches/head (1024/block) — dispatch + lost intra-GEMM
    parallelism outweigh the cache benefit; on M4's unified memory the score-matrix round-trips were never the wall
    (heads already overlap traffic with compute across the 10-way head parallelism).
  bit-exact correctness proof: byte-identical outputs both arms (above); revert restores the exact pre-lever source
  disposition: REVERT (8bd4037 reverts c5e535a, which a concurrent session had committed mid-measurement)
  do-not-retry: "do not re-tile SAM attention on Apple-silicon unified memory unless a profile shows the score matrix

  CPU feature string: aarch64+neon+dotprod (Apple M4; i8mm present but half-rate)
  exact command + env: microbench `FOCR_FORCE_ARCH={sdot,smmla,scalar} cargo bench --bench igemm_tier` (quiet window, error bars 1-10%); e2e `FOCR_DECODE_INT8=1 FOCR_TIMING=1 focr ocr page_0009.png` interleaved A/B pre-lever (FOCR_FORCE_ARCH sdot vs scalar) and post-lever (default vs FOCR_INT8_AUTOVEC=0)
  fallback / kill-switch state: the REPLACEMENT (LLVM-autovec scalar dispatch via `autovec_preferred()`) ships default-ON on macOS aarch64 with `FOCR_INT8_AUTOVEC=0` restoring SDOT; `FOCR_FORCE_ARCH` overrides still honored; detect_tier()/robot backends still report the hardware truth; int4-packed + offline-SMMLA paths unaffected
  measured before -> after vs reference:
    microbench (ns/iter, model shapes): sdot 93,775 / 511,095 / 505,927 (m=1 attn/down/gate_up) vs autovec 21,145 / 114,818 / 114,942 — autovec 4.4-4.5x FASTER at m=1, 2.0x at m=16; SMMLA 2.3-6.2x behind SDOT everywhere (bd-2mo.4.1 verdict)
    e2e int8 decode (98 tokens, identical output bytes): 1.61s/1.58s (sdot) vs 1.27s/1.26s (autovec) pre-lever; 1.64s vs 1.27s post-lever kill-switch A/B = 22% decode win, decode/tok 16.8ms -> 13ms
  bit-exact correctness proof: all tiers are proven bit-identical (exact i32 integer accumulation): the simd tier-parity suite (53 tests incl the randomized + constant-extreme oracles at K=6848) holds every route equal, and both e2e A/B arms emitted BYTE-IDENTICAL 98-token output on page_0009 — the lever changes WHICH exact kernel runs, never a bit of the result.
  WHY (attribution): NE-INH-1's inherited prior finally caught the m=1 GEMV — the hand-written SDOT micro-tile pays per-call setup/blocking the fused autovectorized loop never does, and current LLVM (nightly, 2026) vectorizes the plain i8-dot loop better than the hand kernel at every model shape. The SDOT preference predated this toolchain and was never re-measured at m=1 against autovec.
  disposition: REVERT (the SDOT preference for the dense igemm entrypoints); the replacement autovec dispatch ships default-ON on macOS aarch64 behind FOCR_INT8_AUTOVEC (=0 restores SDOT).
  per-lever tally: W 0 / L 1 / N 0 (the SDOT-at-dense-GEMM preference, first honest m=1-vs-autovec measurement)
  agent: claude (bd-2mo.5.1 / bd-2mo.4.1 quiet-window session, 2026-07-09)
  evidence dir: artifacts/perf/bd-2mo.5.1/ (tier microbench logs, README tables, SHA256SUMS)
  do-not-retry: do NOT re-prefer the SDOT micro-tile for the dense igemm entrypoints on Apple Silicon without a fresh quiet-window tier microbench + e2e pair on the CURRENT toolchain showing SDOT >= autovec; re-measure on new silicon (M5+), new LLVM major, or if the GEMV call pattern changes shape (e.g. fused multi-row batching lands).

    DESIGN: Cephes-split branch-free poly exp (LLVM-autovectorizable, honoring doctrine #3) replacing the per-element libm expf
    inside a transcription of the reference kernel's exact max/pairwise-sum/divide structure. UNIT ACCURACY PROVEN: worst rel err
    2.53e-7 (~2.1 ulp) over [-87, 10]; softmax probability drift <= 1.1e-8 absolute vs the reference kernel.
    WALL CLOCK: sam.forward ref 3.49/3.80 s vs fast 3.75/3.48 s — ZERO. ROOT CAUSE: the "softmax exp = 0.15 s/block" target was
    profiled BEFORE pass 2 made global attention head-parallel; the exp now runs inside the parallel section, amortized across all
    cores (~0.06 s wall ceiling). The lever's premise had already been optimized away by a different lever.
    OUTPUT: the <=1.1e-8 probability drift STILL forked the greedy decode on the FIRST measured page — "CHARING CROSS" (the
    reference's CORRECT reading of the real place name) degraded to "CHAIRING CROSS", plus a heading trajectory fork
    ("THE WORLD'S FIRST" -> "THE WORLD'S LITTLE TOUR"). The fast arm was self-consistent across runs — a deterministic wrong answer.
  bit-exact correctness proof: revert is a net-zero source diff; unarmed byte-identity was structural (branch)

    DESIGN: decode each staff at 0.0/-0.4/+0.4 deg (deskew shear kernel), majority-vote key+time, tie-break by fewest
    bar-sum sanity warnings, final tie -> the 0 deg certified decode.
    corpus gate: unarmed ALL PASS (22.5 s) -> armed 1 FAIL (spohr_no17_sys attributes REGRESSED, time != 3/4) at 62.9 s (2.8x);
    the no21 time XFAIL (the lever's target) did NOT flip.
    MECHANISM (per-candidate logs): micro-rotation makes the model DROP the time signature on degraded 1843 scans
    (3 of 4 measured staves omit timeSignature at ±0.4 deg). An omitted attribute (a) cannot form a majority and
    (b) INVERTS the bar-sum scorer — no declared time means no checkable bar constraint, so the degraded decode scores
    0 warnings and beats the honest 0 deg decode that declared its time and got flagged (no17_sys staff 1: correct
    "3/4 + 3 warnings" lost to "no time + 0 warnings"; no21_sys staff 2: the TRUTH "3/4" at +0.4 deg lost to the silent 0 deg).
    SCORER-V2 DRY RUN (attribute-presence ranked above warning count, evaluated against the same logged candidates):
    fixes the no17_sys regression but still does not flip no21 (staff 2's presence-tie resolves to "C" = 4/4, staff 1's
    majority is 4/4 either way) -> best-known variant nets ZERO corpus improvement at 2.8x cost.

    PERF (x86 trj, Zen3/avx2): the GEMM attention does NOT pay on AVX2 — gemm 211.45 s (−9.5% vs base) and gemm+qkv 230.68 s (only −1.3%, i.e. WORSE than the lossless qkv-alone's 184.66 s / −21%). The frankentorch f32 batched GEMM is not well-served on AVX2; on x86 the GEMM attention actively regresses the qkv win.
    ACCURACY: 20-page content CER 0.2116 -> 1.3030 — CATASTROPHIC, and ENTIRELY one page: 19/20 stay bit-near-exact (4 byte-exact, rest CER < 0.04), but page_0590 (the longest, a repetitive ship-loss TABLE) RUNS AWAY 8755 -> 91243 chars (CER 4.23 that page; gemmqkv_perpage_cer.txt). Rejected on ACCURACY regardless of the perf win; PERF_LEDGER-ineligible (no pinned CPU reference row).
  bit-exact correctness proof:
    NOT bit-exact by construction (the batched GEMM reorders f32 accumulation in QK^T / softmax / probs@V). The drift is tiny per-token but on page_0590 it tips the autoregressive sampler past the EOS-emission tipping point into a degenerate `<tr><td>..Hornet..David Comin..</td></tr>` row-repeat that never terminates (page_0590_runaway_tail.txt). This is the SAME f32-reorder as the SAM vision GEMM (bd-3n16, KEPT) — harmless there because vision attention feeds a projector; disqualifying here because decode attention feeds a token sampler whose EOS timing is fragile on long repetitive pages.
  disposition: REVERT
  do-not-retry: "do not enable FOCR_ATTN_GEMM (non-bit-exact decode attention) unless decode is first made robust to f32-accumulation drift on long repetitive pages — e.g. a bit-exact blocked GEMM that matches the scalar per-key accumulation order, OR a repetition/no-EOS stop guard in the sampler (a semantics change that must clear its own 20-page CER gate). The ~12–15% decode win is real but is already captured LOSSLESSLY by FOCR_QKV_FUSED (the WIN above); the marginal extra (~3–6%) is not worth a page-killing runaway. Bit-exactness is mandatory for decode attention, optional for vision attention."

    PERF (x86 trj, Zen3/avx2): does NOT carry to x86 — int8kv decode 230.51 s / 0.281 s-tok = only −1.3% vs base, far behind the lossless qkv-alone (184.66 s / −21%). The int8-KV dequant + AVX2-emulated int8 QK overhead eats the bandwidth saving; the int8-KV speedup is an M4-only effect.
    ACCURACY: 20-page content CER 0.2116 -> 0.3277 (+55% relative). Not a 1.30 blow-up like FOCR_ATTN_GEMM, but the SAME root cause on the SAME page: int8 KV is lossier than the f32-GEMM reorder, so page_0590 degenerates into the same no-EOS runaway; under the CER-gate forward budget that page's int8-KV decode does not finish -> empty output -> CER 1.0 on that page, which drives the entire +0.116 aggregate (an unbudgeted single-page int8-KV run was still grinding the page_0590 runaway at 7+ min when killed). The other 19 pages are unaffected. PERF_LEDGER-ineligible.
  bit-exact correctness proof:
    NOT bit-exact by construction (int8 quantization of the KV cache is lossy). Same EOS-fragility failure as FOCR_ATTN_GEMM on page_0590, manifesting as a budget-timeout empty page rather than a 91k runaway because the int8-KV decode is slower per runaway token. int8 QK i32-accumulation exactness (no overflow at head_dim=128) is independently covered by the `simd::igemm_s8s8` oracle tests; this entry is an end-to-end ACCURACY rejection.
  disposition: REVERT
  do-not-retry: "do not enable FOCR_INT8_KV unless decode is first made robust to long-page degeneration (same predicate as FOCR_ATTN_GEMM) AND the int8-KV 20-page CER is shown within budget vs base 0.2116. Even then the ceiling is small: int8-KV's only marginal gain over the LOSSLESS FOCR_QKV_FUSED is ~6% decode, not worth a lossy KV cache that fails the hardest page. The attention here (≤405 keys × 10 heads) is not the decode bottleneck — experts (~44%) + the f32 element-wise attention overhead are; a KV-bytes lever cannot move them."

Fresh-eyes review later proved that a same-inode truncate remains possible despite descriptor pinning, so current source defaults to owned bytes and requires explicit `FOCR_MMAP=1` for trusted immutable inodes.

User CPU stayed 31.745 vs 31.85 s, while vision, prefill, and 32-token decode timings remained stable, isolating the benefit to artifact ingestion/ownership.
  bit-exact correctness proof:
    mmap and buffered readers expose the same validated records; all four capped-decode Markdown outputs are byte-identical (sha256 88c668f6a8bed89c014f52ccac478abcccde0e296e483b27c385dafc9570bab4).
  disposition: KEEP CAPABILITY, REJECT AS DEFAULT. The 5.35% warm-cache win is real but cannot outrank the process-fault risk from concurrent same-inode truncation. Owned bytes are the shipping default; mmap is an explicit immutable-inode deployment opt-in.

  CPU feature string: Apple M4 arm64 exposes `aarch64+neon+dotprod`; effective ordinary dense route is `aarch64+llvm-autovec`; eight workers
  exact command + env:
    valid runs in order `autovec,sdot,sdot,autovec`, each using:
    `FOCR_INT8_AUTOVEC=<unset|0> FOCR_MAX_NEW_TOKENS=32 FOCR_THREADS=8 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8 OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 FOCR_RSWA_PARALLEL_ATTN=1 FOCR_TIMING=1 FOCR_PROFILE_DECODE=1 FOCR_STAGE_BUDGET_FORWARD_MS=7200000 /usr/bin/time -p /Volumes/USBNVME16TB/temp_agent_space/cargo-target/release/focr ocr /Volumes/USBNVME16TB/temp_agent_space/franken_ocr_work/pages/page_0014.png --model /Volumes/USBNVME16TB/temp_agent_space/franken_ocr_work/model/unlimited-ocr.recipe-v1.20260709T2304.focrq`
    The hash manifest also preserves one excluded operator-error attempt (`02-sdot.stderr`: `env: -u: No such file or directory`); its empty output and timing are not samples.
  fallback / kill-switch state: Apple ordinary dense int8 defaults to LLVM autovec; `FOCR_INT8_AUTOVEC=0|off|false|no` restores SDOT when no valid `FOCR_FORCE_ARCH` override is active. Packed-int4 and offline-SMMLA-panel entrypoints are unaffected.
  measured before -> after vs reference:
    local focr-only interleaved A/B (two valid samples/mode; no pinned torch CPU ratio): forced SDOT median decode 0.915 s -> autovec 0.830 s (-9.29%, 1.102x); median expert phase 269.5 -> 180.0 ms (-33.21%, 1.497x). Non-expert phases were stable. Whole-page wall was startup-dominated, so no end-to-end speed claim is made from these four samples.
  bit-exact correctness proof:
    all four valid Markdown outputs are byte-identical (sha256 88c668f6a8bed89c014f52ccac478abcccde0e296e483b27c385dafc9570bab4). Runtime selftest now separates hardware selection from the effective dense route and records the branch executed by every S8S8/U8S8 case.
  disposition: KEEP (autovec default; SDOT deterministic fallback and forced-route proof retained)
  do-not-retry: "do not make a hand-written SDOT micro-tile the Apple dense-GEMV default without a new real-decode A/B that beats LLVM autovec and remains byte-identical."

  exact command + env:

  fallback / kill-switch state: environment unset restores the measured Apple autovec default. Valid forced tiers override autovec; unknown or unavailable tags are ignored. Each intrinsic/scalar path remains available for parity diagnosis.
  measured before -> after vs reference:
    local focr-only reverse-order sweep (two samples/tier; no pinned torch CPU ratio): scalar/autovec-equivalent decode median 0.830 s and experts 180.5 ms. SDOT was 0.920 s/+10.84% and 268.5 ms/+48.75%. SMMLA was 1.420 s/+71.08% and 771.5 ms/+327.42%. One SDOT wall sample had unrelated 7.75 s startup noise; phase timers, not wall time, determine this disposition.
  bit-exact correctness proof:
    all six Markdown outputs are byte-identical (sha256 88c668f6a8bed89c014f52ccac478abcccde0e296e483b27c385dafc9570bab4). Forced-route subprocess tests require `selected`, `hardware_selected`, and the branch-derived singleton `executed_routes` to name the forced implementation.
  disposition: KEEP ROUTES, REJECT AS APPLE DEFAULTS (scalar/autovec remains fastest; routes retained for portability and proof)
  do-not-retry: "do not promote SDOT or SMMLA from instruction-count intuition. Retry only after changing the kernel's measured load/packing cost, then repeat the exact real-decode tier sweep."

  bit-exact correctness proof: neither output is exact or release-eligible. `compare_ocr.py` scored both against the pinned BF16 reference; its exact bit-parallel Levenshtein replacement matched the former DP over 16,129 exhaustive and 10,000 randomized Unicode pairs.
