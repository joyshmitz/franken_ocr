# METAMORPHIC.md — the oracle-free invariant catalog

**Bead:** `bd-re8.10` (VERIFY-metamorphic-suite) — the metamorphic leg of the
conformance pillar (plan §8.3, [`/testing-metamorphic`]). This document is the
**catalog of metamorphic relations** the `franken_ocr` engine must satisfy
**without** consulting the PyTorch oracle. It is the design spec the test suite
(`tests/metamorphic.rs`) implements; the suite is gated on a working end-to-end
path (`bd-re8.7`, the L5 gate) and, for the multi-page relation, on **OQ-13**.

> **Why metamorphic at all.** Differential testing (`bd-re8.9`) proves "same
> answer as the bf16 reference" — but it can only run on the frozen golden
> corpus, and it *inherits any bug the oracle also has*. Metamorphic testing
> proves **self-consistency under input transformations**: it runs on arbitrary
> generated inputs (no oracle, no 6.67 GB weights needed for the relations that

> to — e.g. a coordinate-system bug that the oracle shares, or a non-determinism
> leak that only shows up across runs. The two suites are complementary, not
> redundant. **A metamorphic relation that encodes a falsehood is worse than no
> test** (see §6, the multi-page trap); every relation below is derived from the

## Scope boundary (what lives here vs. elsewhere)

This suite covers **oracle-free invariants under content-preserving (or
content-relating) transforms**: identity-resize, 90°-rotation/transpose,
whitespace padding, run-to-run determinism, and the cross-page-dependence
property. It does **NOT** cover:

- **Malformed / adversarial input** (corrupt or truncated images, mid-decode
  cancellation, budget-exceeded) — that is the **fault** leg of the conformance
  pillar (plan §8.5), owned by `VERIFY-r1-fault-suite`. Keep the boundary explicit
  so robustness coverage is not assumed to live here.
- **"Same as the reference"** numeric parity (the L0–L5 ladder) — that is the
  differential suite (`bd-re8.9`) and the parity gates (plan §8.2).
- **Surface / contract** snapshots (`focr ocr --json`, `--help`, robot NDJSON) —
  that is the golden-artifact suite
  ([`GOLDEN.md`](GOLDEN.md), `bd-re8.11`).

## 0. How a metamorphic relation is stated (the shape every entry follows)

A metamorphic relation is a pair **(input transform `T`, output relation `R`)**
such that for every input `x`, `R(focr(x), focr(T(x)))` must hold. We state each
relation as:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Transform `T`** | the deterministic input mutation (pixel-domain, page-order, etc.). |
| **Relation `R`** | the property that must hold between `focr(x)` and `focr(T(x))`. |
| **Strength** | `STRICT` (bit/string-exact equality) · `STRUCTURAL` (equal up to a documented coordinate map) · `EXISTENTIAL` (a dependence/change *may* exist — the relation asserts the *possibility*, never independence). |
| **Determinism precondition** | every relation runs under `temperature=0` greedy (`do_sample=False`) so the engine is a pure function of (image, args); the determinism relation (MR-4) *proves* this precondition. |
| **Generator** | how the transformed-input pairs are produced. |
| **Structured-log line** | the NDJSON the test emits: `{relation, n_cases, violations, ...}`. |
| **Source backing** | the `[SPEC-NNN]`/OQ clause the relation is derived from. |

**Determinism is the foundation of every other relation.** A relation of the form
`focr(x) == focr(T(x))` is only meaningful if `focr(x)` is itself reproducible;
otherwise an equality failure is ambiguous (transform bug vs. run-to-run noise).
So **MR-4 (Base-mode determinism) is asserted first** and is a precondition for
MR-1, MR-3, and the strict half of MR-2. The engine is deterministic by
construction under greedy decoding (plan §7.3, §1.1 G5: "same image+args →
byte-identical output"); MR-4 is the guard that keeps it so.

### Per-relation structured logging

Every relation emits exactly one NDJSON summary line on completion and one line
per violation (so a CI failure is self-describing and grep-able):

```jsonc
// summary (always)
{"suite":"metamorphic","relation":"MR-1","n_cases":64,"violations":0,
 "strength":"STRICT","gated_on":null,"elapsed_ms":1234}
// per-violation (only on failure)
{"suite":"metamorphic","relation":"MR-2","case_id":"rot90_doc07","kind":"bbox_map",
 "expected":[12,40,88,120],"actual":[11,41,88,121],"tol_px":1,"detail":"x2 off by 2px"}
```

## MR-1 — Identity-resize invariance (recognized text)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Transform `T`** | Resize the input image to **its own current dimensions** (a no-op resize): `img.resize((w, h))` where `(w, h) == img.size`. Also covers re-encoding the same pixels to the same on-disk format. |
| **Relation `R`** | `text(focr(x)) == text(focr(T(x)))` — the recognized text is **byte-identical**. |
| **Strength** | `STRICT`. |
| **Source backing** | The preprocess front end is a pure function of the decoded RGB pixel buffer: EXIF-transpose on load (`[SPEC-020]`), aspect-preserving pad to square with fill `(127,127,127)` (`[SPEC-022]`), `ToTensor` then `Normalize(0.5,0.5)` → `[-1,1]` (`[SPEC-021]`). A no-op resize does not touch the pixel buffer that reaches `BasicImageTransform`, so the entire downstream forward is identical. |

**Why this is a real test, not a tautology.** It is the cheapest possible probe
that the **decode → preprocess** boundary is *idempotent and side-effect-free*: no
hidden global state, no run-counter in the buffer, no accidental dependence on the
file path or mtime, no off-by-one in the resize/pad geometry that a same-size
resize would still trigger. A surprising number of preprocessing bugs (a stray
`+1` in a tile-count, a buffer reused across calls, an RNG seeded from the clock)
surface here first. It is also the **degenerate case of MR-3** (zero-width
whitespace pad), so a failure here localizes the bug to resize/identity before the
padding logic is even exercised.

**Generator.** Take each fixture in the metamorphic corpus (§7), read its
`(w, h)`, produce the pair `(x, x.resize((w, h)))`. Include at least one image
whose dimensions are **not** a multiple of the tile size (640) and one that is, so
the pad/tile geometry is exercised both ways.

**Caveat.** This is invariance of the **decoded-pixel → text** path, so the two
inputs must decode to the **same RGB buffer**. Re-encoding through a *lossy* codec
(JPEG round-trip) is **not** an identity transform and must not be asserted under
MR-1 (it changes pixels); use the original decoded buffer or a lossless re-encode
(PNG). The test generates the resized image **in-memory from the decoded buffer**
to avoid an accidental lossy round-trip.

---

## MR-2 — 90°-rotation / transpose bbox relationships

| | |
|---|---|
| **Transform `T`** | Rotate the page by a multiple of 90° (`rot90`, `rot180`, `rot270`) or transpose it. These are the **exact-pixel-permutation** rotations (no resampling, no interpolation, lossless). |
| **Relation `R`** | The recognized **content** is preserved (same labels/text spans, possibly reordered), and every emitted bounding box transforms by the **known coordinate map** for that rotation, within a ±1-pixel rounding tolerance. |
| **Strength** | `STRUCTURAL` (equal up to the documented coordinate map; **not** `STRICT`, because reading order / span ordering may legitimately change with orientation). |
| **Source backing** | Boxes are emitted by the model as **normalized integer coordinates in `[0, 999]`** (`[SPEC-113]`), then rescaled to pixels at draw time via `x = int(coord / 999 * image_width)` (`modeling_unlimitedocr.py:104-111`). The rotation map operates in the **normalized `[0,999]` space**, before pixel rescale. EXIF-transpose-on-load (`[SPEC-020]`) means the *engine* sees the rotated raster directly. |

**The coordinate map (the load-bearing math).** A box is the 4-tuple
`(x1, y1, x2, y2)` of normalized coordinates with `0 ≤ · ≤ 999`, `x1 ≤ x2`,
`y1 ≤ y2`. Working in the **normalized square** (treat the page as `[0,999]²`; the
±1 tolerance below absorbs the difference between the true aspect-correct map and
the normalized-square map — see the caveat), the rotation of a point `(x, y)` is:

| Rotation `T` | Point map `(x, y) →` | Box map `(x1,y1,x2,y2) →` (re-sorted to min/max) |
|---|---|---|
| `rot90` (CCW) | `(y, 999 − x)` | `(y1, 999 − x2, y2, 999 − x1)` |
| `rot90` (CW) / `rot270` | `(999 − y, x)` | `(999 − y2, x1, 999 − y1, x2)` |
| `rot180` | `(999 − x, 999 − y)` | `(999 − x2, 999 − y2, 999 − x1, 999 − y1)` |
| `transpose` (main diag) | `(y, x)` | `(y1, x1, y2, x2)` |

After the map, the test **re-sorts** each box to `(min x, min y, max x, max y)` so
`x1 ≤ x2`, `y1 ≤ y2` (the rotation can swap which corner is the minimum). The
relation `R` is then: **the multiset of mapped boxes from `focr(x)` equals the
multiset of boxes from `focr(T(x))`**, matched by their associated label/text,
each coordinate within `±1` (the `int(... )` floor in the `/999` rescale loses up
to one unit each way; the corner re-sort and the normalized-square approximation
each contribute at most one more — budget `tol_px = 1` in normalized units, `≤ 2`
after pixel rescale on a 1000px page; widen proportionally for larger pages and
record the chosen tolerance in the structured log).

**Why exact-90° only.** Arbitrary-angle rotation **resamples** pixels
(interpolation), which changes the decoded RGB buffer and therefore can legitimately
change recognition — it is **not** a metamorphic-safe transform and must not be
asserted. Only the four lossless orientations (`rot90`/`rot180`/`rot270`/transpose),
which are pure pixel permutations, preserve content. The generator is restricted to
these.

**Content sub-relation (`STRICT` half).** Independent of geometry, the **set of
recognized text spans** (after stripping orientation-dependent reading order — sort
spans canonically, e.g. by mapped top-left) must be **equal** between `x` and
`T(x)`. A rotation that *drops* or *invents* a text span is a bug even if every
surviving box maps correctly. The test asserts both halves and logs which half
failed.

**Caveat — aspect ratio and the normalized space.** The normalized `[0,999]²`
coordinate map above is exact only when the box coordinates are interpreted in the
**square normalized frame** the model emits them in. The model normalizes against
the *padded square* view, not the original aspect ratio, so the `[0,999]²` rotation
is the correct frame and the `±1` tolerance covers the integer floor. If a future
mode emits boxes against the *unpadded* image, the map must compose with the
pad-offset transform; that is recorded as a follow-up if such a mode is added. For
v1 (base/Gundam, padded-square views), the `[0,999]²` map is correct.

**Generator.** For each fixture, emit pairs `(x, rot90(x))`, `(x, rot180(x))`,
`(x, rot270(x))`, `(x, transpose(x))`, using exact-pixel-permutation rotation
(`image::imageops::rotate90` etc. — no resampling). Prefer fixtures with **at
least one grounding/`<|det|>` box** so the geometry relation is actually exercised
(a pure-prose page with no boxes only exercises the content sub-relation).

---

## MR-3 — Whitespace-pad invariance (recognized text)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Transform `T`** | Surround the page with a border of **uniform background-colored** pixels (extend the canvas, place the original content unchanged inside, fill the new border). |
| **Relation `R`** | `text(focr(x)) == text(focr(T(x)))` — recognized text is **byte-identical**; bboxes shift by the known pad offset (the `STRUCTURAL` half, analogous to MR-2's map but a pure translation + rescale). |
| **Strength** | `STRICT` on text; `STRUCTURAL` on box geometry. |
| **Source backing** | The preprocess front end *already* pads every input to a square with fill `(127,127,127)` before the forward (`[SPEC-022]`, `ImageOps.pad(..., color=(127,127,127))`). Adding more uniform border before that step should be absorbed by the same aspect-preserving pad/resize and leave the *content* region's features unchanged up to the resize resampling. |

**⚠️ The fill-color subtlety (the gotcha the bead flags).** The relation is
"**whitespace**-pad invariance," but the model's own pad color is **gray
`(127,127,127)`** — the dataset mean, mapped to `0` under the `[-1,1]` normalize
(`[SPEC-022]`, `[SPEC-021]`), **not** white `(255,255,255)`. There are therefore
**two distinct transforms**, and the relation must use the right one:

1. **MR-3a — mean-gray pad (the safe, primary relation).** Pad with the model's
   own fill `(127,127,127)`. This maps to exactly `0` after normalization — the
   same value the internal pad produces — so the bordered region is
   representationally identical to the model's own padding. This is the
   **defensible STRICT relation** and the one the suite asserts as a hard gate.
2. **MR-3b — true-white pad (a SHOULD, not a MUST).** Pad with white
   `(255,255,255)`. White is **not** the model's pad color; it maps to `+1` after
   normalization and is *visible content* to the encoder. Padding with white can
   legitimately change recognition (the model may treat a white margin as page
   structure). MR-3b is asserted only as an **EXISTENTIAL/SHOULD** observation
   (record whether text changed; do **not** fail the build on a change) and is
   ledgered as a known sensitivity, not a bug.

**Verify the pad color against the actual implementation, not the prose.** The
test reads the fill color from the same constant the preprocess uses (it must not
hard-code `127` independently); if the preprocess pad color ever changes,
MR-3a's transform changes with it. This is the bead's explicit risk note
("Whitespace-padding invariance assumes the pad gray (127) is outside the
recognized content — verify against the actual pad color").

**Box geometry sub-relation.** When MR-3a adds a border of `p` pixels on a side,
every emitted box translates by the pad offset and rescales by the new dimensions:
in normalized space, a content box at normalized `c` on the unpadded `W` maps to
`int((c/999·W + p) / W_padded · 999)` — a pure affine map the test applies and
checks within `±1` normalized unit, the same tolerance discipline as MR-2.

**Generator.** For each fixture, emit `(x, pad(x, p, fill=mean_gray))` for a few
border widths `p ∈ {8, 32, 128}` px on each side and asymmetric (left/top only),
to exercise both the geometry offset and the resize-to-square interaction. Include
the **zero-width** pad (`p = 0`) as the bridge to MR-1 (identity).

## MR-4 — Base-mode determinism across runs

| | |
|---|---|
| **Transform `T`** | **Identity** — run the *same* image with the *same* args **twice** (and at two thread counts: `FOCR_THREADS=1` and `FOCR_THREADS=N`). |
| **Relation `R`** | `focr(x)` is **byte-identical** across runs and across thread counts: same decoded text, same token sequence, same bbox tuples, same `--json` payload (after scrubbing only timing/run-id, never content). |
| **Strength** | `STRICT`. |
| **Source backing** | Greedy decode (`temperature=0` → `do_sample=False`, plan §7.3); the int8 GEMM is **bit-identical across SIMD paths** (integer add is exact/associative — plan §5.4); the engine is a pure function of (image, args). The f32 forward must reduce in a fixed order so thread count does not perturb the result (this is the engine's design obligation, plan §1.1 G5 / §7.3). |

**Why this is the keystone relation.** It is both a test *and* a precondition.
Every `focr(x) == focr(T(x))` relation (MR-1, MR-3a, the strict half of MR-2)
silently assumes `focr(x)` is reproducible; MR-4 is what makes that assumption
checkable. A determinism leak — a HashMap iteration order in the router, a
thread-count-dependent reduction order in a GEMM accumulator, a clock-seeded RNG,
an uninitialized buffer — is the single most corrosive bug class here because it
makes *every other relation flap intermittently*. MR-4 catches it directly, with
no oracle and no transform.

**Thread-count axis is mandatory.** Running twice at the *same* thread count
catches RNG/iteration-order leaks; running at **two different thread counts**
additionally catches **reduction-order non-associativity** (the classic
"`@8` ≠ `@32`" float-sum drift). The f32 reference forward must therefore use a
deterministic reduction (fixed tiling / tree-reduce independent of thread count),
not a `rayon` `sum()` whose order depends on work-stealing. MR-4 is the gate that
holds the engine to that.

**Generator.** For each fixture, run `{(seed_run=1, threads=1), (seed_run=2,
threads=1), (seed_run=3, threads=N)}` and assert all three byte-identical
(content fields). The structured log records the first divergent field and offset
on failure, so a determinism regression is immediately localized.

**Relationship to the golden suite.** MR-4 proves the *engine* is deterministic;
[`GOLDEN.md`](GOLDEN.md)'s scrubbed-NDJSON and exact-JSON snapshots then freeze
that deterministic output forever. MR-4 is the upstream guarantee that makes the
golden snapshots non-flaky; the golden suite is the downstream regression catch.

---

## MR-5 — Multi-page CROSS-PAGE dependence (the corrected relation, OQ-13)

> **⚠️ THE TRAP.** The naïve metamorphic relation here is
> *"multi-page concat = sum of single-page parses"* — i.e. `parse([p1, p2, …,
> pN])` equals `concat(parse(p1), parse(p2), …, parse(pN))`. **This relation is
> FALSE and must NEVER be asserted.** Encoding it would bake a falsehood into the
> conformance suite — the most dangerous metamorphic failure mode (a green test
> that certifies wrong behavior). OQ-13 is **RESOLVED** and it resolves
> *against* independence.

### What OQ-13 actually established

In multi-page mode (`infer_multi`), **all pages' image tokens are concatenated
into a single contiguous prefill in one `generate()` call**
(`modeling_unlimitedocr.py:1198-1212, 1233-1237, 1240-1256`;
[`../truth-pack/oq/rswa-attention.md`](../truth-pack/oq/rswa-attention.md) OQ-13).
During that single prefill, page *N*'s tokens attend **causally** to every token
of pages `1..N-1`. Under R-SWA the entire multi-page prefix is the **permanent,
never-evicted reference block** (`config.sliding_window` is nulled precisely so
`DynamicCache` does not truncate it; the 128-slot ring bounds only the *generated*
tail — OQ-1/OQ-3/OQ-13). **Therefore the multi-page decode is cross-page
DEPENDENT**: page *N*'s output is a function of pages `1..N`, not of page *N*
alone. The output is **not** a concatenation of independent single-page parses.

### The correct relation (the OPPOSITE of independence)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Transform `T`** | Reorder the page sequence (e.g. swap pages `i` and `j`, or reverse) **or** mutate an earlier page's content, in a multi-page parse. |
| **Relation `R` (MR-5a, EXISTENTIAL — dependence exists)** | There **exists** a multi-page input for which changing page order or an earlier page's content **changes** a later page's output. The relation asserts the *possibility* of cross-page influence — it is a **dependence-existence** property, never an independence property. |
| **Relation `R` (MR-5b, STRICT — single-page is self-consistent)** | The **first** page of a multi-page parse, when that page has no preceding context, is governed by the single-page relations (MR-1/MR-3a/MR-4); i.e. `parse([p1])` is deterministic and equals the single-image parse of `p1`. This anchors one end without claiming independence for the tail. |
| **Relation `R` (MR-5c, STRUCTURAL — prefix-stability under append)** | **Appending** a page to the *end* of the sequence does not change the prefill KV of the earlier pages (the reference prefix is causal and append-only at prefill), so the **earlier pages' contribution to the reference block is stable**; this is a structural property of the prefill assembly, not an output-equality claim on the generated text (the generated text still depends on the full prefix at decode time). |
| **Strength** | `EXISTENTIAL` (MR-5a) · `STRICT` (MR-5b) · `STRUCTURAL` (MR-5c). |
| **Source backing** | OQ-13 (`modeling_unlimitedocr.py:1198-1212, 1233-1237, 1240-1256`); OQ-1 (permanent prefill prefix, `modeling_deepseekv2.py:1322, 1363-1364`); OQ-3 (ring bounds only the decoded tail). |

**Why phrase MR-5a as existential, not universal.** We assert that cross-page
dependence *can* occur (and we construct at least one input pair that
demonstrates it), **not** that *every* reorder changes output — many reorders of
independent pages may coincidentally produce identical output, and asserting
universal change would be as false as asserting independence. The defensible,
non-falsifiable-into-a-lie statement is the existence one: *the engine's
multi-page output is a function of the whole page set, demonstrably so on at
least one constructed case.* This is the bead's explicit requirement: "asserts
cross-page dependence, NOT independence."

**Gating.** MR-5 is **gated on a working multi-page e2e path** (the model and the
`infer_multi`-equivalent prefill assembly) **and** is anchored by the
already-RESOLVED OQ-13. Until the multi-page path exists, only MR-1..MR-4
(single-page) are asserted; MR-5 is enumerated here (so it is not silent coverage
debt) and lands with the multi-page decode bead. **The suite must never, at any
phase, assert the independence/sum-of-parses relation** — that prohibition is
unconditional and predates the multi-page path existing.

**Construction recipe for the MR-5a witness.** Build a 2-page input where page 2's
correct parse is *ambiguous in isolation* but disambiguated by page 1 (e.g. a
table whose header is on page 1, continued rows on page 2; or a document where an
earlier page establishes a definition a later page references). Show that
`parse([p1, p2])` differs from `parse([blank, p2])` on page 2's region. One such
witness in the corpus discharges MR-5a.

---

## 6. The single most important rule of this catalog

**Never assert a relation that is not entailed by the model's documented
semantics.** A wrong metamorphic relation is strictly worse than a missing one: a
missing relation leaves a gap (visible coverage debt), but a *wrong* relation is a
**green test that certifies incorrect behavior** and actively prevents the bug it
should catch from ever surfacing. The two ways to get this wrong here, both
explicitly guarded above:

1. **Asserting multi-page independence** (MR-5) — refuted by OQ-13. The suite
   asserts the *opposite* (cross-page dependence exists).
2. **Asserting white-pad invariance as a hard gate** (MR-3) — white is not the
   model's pad color; only **mean-gray** pad is representationally invariant.
   White-pad is a SHOULD observation, not a MUST.

Each relation above is line-backed to a `[SPEC-NNN]` clause or an OQ answer; a
relation with no source backing does not ship.

---

## 7. The metamorphic corpus & generator

The suite needs **inputs to transform**, not reference outputs (that is the whole
point of being oracle-free). The corpus is a small set of committable document
images spanning the regimes the relations exercise:

| Corpus slice | Why | Exercises |
|---|---|---|
| Dense prose page | the common case | MR-1, MR-3a, MR-4 |
| Page with grounding boxes (`<\|det\|>`) | geometry relations need boxes | MR-2 (both halves), MR-3a (box offset) |
| Non-square page (aspect ≠ 1) | the pad-to-square + rotation interaction | MR-2, MR-3a |
| Dimensions not a multiple of 640 | tile-geometry edge | MR-1, MR-3a |
| 2-page constructed dependence pair | the OQ-13 witness | MR-5a |

The **generator** is a pure-Rust transform library (`image` crate: lossless
`rotate90/180/270`, `flip`, in-memory same-size resize, mean-gray border pad) that
takes a corpus image and emits the `(x, T(x))` pair for each relation. It uses
**no oracle and no model weights** for the pixel-domain transforms; the e2e
relations consume the same model-gated path as the L5 gate (skip-with-SUCCESS when
weights are absent, per plan §8.3 model-gated e2e). Every generated case carries a
stable `case_id` (e.g. `rot90_doc07`) for the structured log.

## 8. Test inventory (what `tests/metamorphic.rs` must contain)

- **One `#[test]` per relation** (MR-1..MR-5), each emitting the summary NDJSON
  line and per-violation lines (§0).
- **The generator** producing transformed input pairs (§7), unit-tested for the
  coordinate maps themselves (MR-2's `(x,y)→` maps and MR-3a's affine offset are
  pure functions — test them directly with hand-worked examples, independent of
  the model).
- **MR-4 thread-axis harness**: runs the engine at `FOCR_THREADS=1` and
  `FOCR_THREADS=N` and asserts byte-identity.
- **The negative guard**: an explicit comment / doc-test asserting the suite
  **does not** and **must not** contain a multi-page sum-of-parts assertion —
  pointing at this document and OQ-13. (A test that *fails to compile* if such an
  assertion is reintroduced is ideal, but at minimum a load-bearing comment.)
- **Coverage line**: the suite emits a final
  `{"suite":"metamorphic","relations_total":5,"relations_run":R,"relations_gated":G}`
  rollup so the gauntlet (plan §8.5) can account this leg.

## 9. Relationship to the conformance pillar (plan §8.3 / §8.5)

| Suite | Question it answers | This doc's role |
|---|---|---|
| **Differential** (`bd-re8.9`) | "same as the bf16 reference?" | complementary — runs on the golden corpus, inherits oracle bugs |
| **Metamorphic** (this, `bd-re8.10`) | "self-consistent under transforms, no oracle?" | **catalogued here** |
| **Golden** ([`GOLDEN.md`](GOLDEN.md), `bd-re8.11`) | "did the frozen surface/numeric output change?" | downstream of MR-4's determinism guarantee |
| **Fault** (`VERIFY-r1-fault-suite`) | "graceful on malformed input?" | out of scope here (§Scope boundary) |

The metamorphic leg feeds the gauntlet's **conformance pillar**: each relation is
a `ConformanceTest` (requirement level `MUST` for MR-1/MR-2/MR-3a/MR-4, `MUST`
for the MR-5 *prohibition* and `SHOULD`/gated for MR-5a..c, `SHOULD` for MR-3b),
contributing to the ≥0.95 MUST-coverage accounting (plan §8.6). A relation
violation is a hard parity-cell failure — the release scorecard cannot ship with a
red metamorphic cell (plan §8.4).
