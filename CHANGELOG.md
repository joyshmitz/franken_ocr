# Changelog

All notable changes to `franken_ocr` are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Scope note.** Work began on 2026-06-24 as a planning and scaffolding effort and
reached a working, end-to-end engine for the first tagged release on 2026-06-29.
The pre-release kickoff (master plan, crate skeleton, agent conventions, oracle
harness) is no longer tracked as a separate `Unreleased` wave; it is folded into
the `0.1.0` history below where it belongs. Going forward, history lives in git and
in the `.beads/` issue graph, and capability waves are promoted into dated version
sections as they land.

## [Unreleased]

Direction after `0.1.0`. Nothing here has shipped; these are the next workstreams.

- **int4 expert quantization.** Group-quantized int4 expert weights at a
  Q4_K_M-class footprint, gated on a measured character-error-rate budget. A packed
  int4 s4s8 micro-kernel and exploratory `FOCR_EXPERTS_INT4` / `FOCR_LMHEAD_INT4`
  experiments already exist behind kill switches, but int4 is not validated and
  `focr convert` accepts only int8 in this release.
- **Native Windows (x86_64)** (epic `bd-3u97`). The `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target now
  compiles with zero errors and `focr.exe` runs full OCR end-to-end on Windows 10:
  `--version` reports `focr 0.1.0`, `robot backends` selects AVX2 via runtime ISA
  detection, `robot selftest` passes 24/24 (int8 GEMM bit-identical to the scalar oracle,
  including the K=6848 i32-overflow case), and `focr ocr page.png` on a real scanned page
  produces the same markdown as a Mac or Linux host. The model cache resolves to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\franken_ocr\models` (falling back to
  `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\franken_ocr\models`), and an `install.ps1` one-liner downloads
  and SHA256-verifies the Windows binary. Two gaps remain under `bd-3u97`: `focr pull`
  does not work on Windows yet (an IOCP send-path bug surfaces as `WSAENOTCONN` /
  os error 10057, tracked as `bd-15ow`; fetch the weights elsewhere and copy
  `unlimited-ocr.focrq` + `tokenizer.json` into the cache, or pass `--model`), and
  ARM64 Windows is not published.
- **The full conformance ladder.** Extend the seeded parity ladder into the complete
  three-pillar gauntlet (oracle, differential, metamorphic) with per-stage exit
  gates across the whole forward path.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

First tagged release. `franken_ocr` is a pure-Rust, memory-safe, CPU-only runner for
the Baidu Unlimited-OCR document-parsing VLM: no Python, no CUDA, no FFI at inference,
no GPU. The library plus the `focr` CLI parse a document image into structured
markdown (or JSON) end to end. On a real page the int8 path matched the Baidu
reference to a measured character-error-rate of 0.0094, agreeing with the reference
oracle to within one token and beating it on one token; that is a measured result on
the 6.67 GB model, not a target. Earlier README and changelog copy that called this a
"pre-Phase-0 scaffold that does not run yet" is superseded by this release.

### Added

**Forward path: fp32 reference parity, then int8.** A framework-free forward built
from a thin substrate facade and nine engine modules. The vision tower
(SAM-ViT-B, 16x conv token compressor, CLIP-L/14) and the 2048 to 1280 projector
were proven against the Baidu reference at cosine 0.9996
([4a56122](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/4a56122)); the
DeepSeek-V2 MoE decoder (12 layers, hidden 1280, 10 heads, head_dim 128; layer 0
dense, layers 1 to 11 routing top-6 of 64 experts plus 2 shared experts) and the
`lm_head` were proven argmax-exact
([c864604](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/c864604)), then
the production `focr ocr` path was wired and proven argmax-exact against the reference
end to end
([ad798b4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/ad798b4)).

**int8 decode engine.** A per-channel S8S8 decode engine on SDOT/VNNI delivers roughly
6.5x prefill and 2.5x decode with zero accuracy loss on easy pages
([d067900](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/d067900)), on top
of a bespoke parallel SIMD GEMV with a dequant-once weight cache
([a2e48ea](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/a2e48ea)),
per-expert parallelism
([c33be34](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/c33be34)), and a
fused q/k/v decode GEMV
([41d9a94](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/41d9a94)). The int8
path is byte-identical to f32 on easy pages; the vision tower stays high precision
because quantizing it wrecks OCR.

**R-SWA decode and KV cache.** Reference Sliding Window Attention is wired into decode:
generated-token KV is bounded to a window of 128 via a ring-buffer cache, while the
reference block (visual plus prompt tokens) is kept as a frozen, never-evicted global
KV. The O(n) ring-cache decode was proven bit-identical to the stateless reference
([c9e751a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/c9e751a)), with a
batched `BatchedRingCache` for multi-stream decode
([a59dfdc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/a59dfdc)).

**`focr convert`.** Offline weight transformation from bf16 safetensors into a custom
int8 `.focrq` artifact, with write-invariant validation and a single-source license
notice
([1ff638e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/1ff638e),
[c86680e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/c86680e)). Proven
byte-identical to the load-time int8 path on the real model (6,672,547,120 bytes of
bf16 down to 3,914,093,440 bytes of int8, about 3.9 GB), with the source SHA256
stamped into the artifact header.

**`focr pull`.** Auto-downloads the int8 weights (about 3.9 GB) over asupersync's
native HTTP stack (rustls plus webpki-roots, not reqwest or ureq), reassembles the
GitHub split parts, verifies every byte by SHA256 against a committed manifest, and
caches to `~/.cache/franken_ocr/models` so subsequent runs are fully offline
([4601ea3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/4601ea3),
[cadfcdf](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/cadfcdf)).
`tokenizer.json` is fetched as a sidecar beside the weights. Production-verified
against this repo's `models-v1` GitHub release and a Hugging Face mirror. A failed
download leaves no `.partial` behind
([47c339c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/47c339c)). On an
interactive TTY, `focr ocr` with no local model offers to download; robot mode and
non-TTY never auto-download and instead emit a model-not-found result with a
`focr pull` hint.

**Runtime ISA dispatch.** One binary per architecture detects CPU features at load and
selects the best int8 kernel tier: ARM SDOT and SMMLA (i8mm), x86 AVX2, AVX-VNNI, and
AVX-512-VNNI. SDOT is preferred over SMMLA on Apple Silicon after an A/B measurement,
and `FOCR_FORCE_ARCH` can pin a tier
([c387841](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/c387841)). On a
Threadripper 5995WX (a Zen 3 part with an AVX2 ceiling) dispatch correctly selects
AVX2.

**`focr robot selftest`.** Re-runs the dispatched int8 GEMM against a bit-identical
scalar oracle across a shape battery, including the worst-case K=6848 i32-accumulation
overflow, and emits a single JSON verdict (exit 1 on any divergence)
([59efd78](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/59efd78)). Proven
24/24 on Apple SDOT and on a real x86 AVX2 host.

**Throughput: batched and continuous decode.** A `focr ocr-batch` command loads the
model once and reuses the amortized int8 weight cache across many images
([61bf415](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/61bf415)). The
128-core throughput epic (`bd-1azu`) landed a continuous-batch decode scheduler driven
through `ocr-batch`, batched per-layer projection / grouped-MoE / R-SWA attention over
B streams, a batched K-token verify forward, and a lossless speculative-decode loop,
each parity-gated bit-identical to sequential decode
([f56dd0b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/f56dd0b),
[f507ea7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/f507ea7)).

**CLI surface.** The full command set: `ocr`, `ocr-batch`, `convert`, `pull`,
`robot run`, `robot schema`, `robot health`, `robot backends`, `robot selftest`, plus
the Phase-0/Phase-5 scaffolds `runs`, `sync export-jsonl`, `sync import-jsonl`, and
`doctor`
([5b26674](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/5b26674)). `ocr`
routes through the native model resolver with crop fusion and an n-gram fallback
([3614ba5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/3614ba5)).
Inference tuning flags (`--base-size`, `--image-size`, `--crop-mode` with a default of
`gundam` dynamic-resolution tiling, `--max-length`, `--temperature`,
`--no-repeat-ngram`, `--ngram-window`) are shared by `ocr` and `robot run`. Recognized
environment variables: `FOCR_MODEL_PATH`, `FOCR_MANIFEST_URL`, `FOCR_NO_REPEAT_NGRAM`,
`FOCR_FORCE_ARCH`, `FOCR_STAGE_BUDGET_FORWARD_MS`, and `HOME` (for cache resolution).

**Robot mode.** A versioned NDJSON event stream (`run_start`, stage, page,
`run_complete`, `run_error`); `focr robot schema` self-describes the contract, and
the exit-code contract is wired into `run_error` events
([91015aa](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/91015aa)). Stable,
documented process exit codes: 0 success, 1 generic / not-yet-implemented, 2 usage,
3 model-not-found, 4 image-decode failure, 5 budget or timeout exceeded,
6 cooperative cancel, 7 format or version mismatch.

**Cross-platform binary release.** Four prebuilt single-file binaries, each a raw
executable (not a tar.gz) with a `<asset>.sha256` sidecar, sizes about 4.7 to 5.9 MB:
`focr-aarch64-apple-darwin-neon-sdot-i8mm` (Apple Silicon),
`focr-x86_64-apple-darwin` (Intel Mac), `focr-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and
`focr-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`. Linux binaries are gnu (glibc), not musl. There is
one binary per architecture that dispatches ISA at runtime, with no per-CPU-feature
variant; the Linux x86-64 binary is selftest-verified on real AVX2
([8c7bed4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/8c7bed4)).

**Verification harness and oracle.** A Baidu reference oracle with a per-stage
activation dump and a CER scorer
([16af5cb](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/16af5cb)), real
engine subject-seam capture against the oracle (projector L1/L2, `lm_head` L3), and a
seeded parity-ladder contract that gates correctness before speed.

**Project foundation (folded from the pre-release kickoff).** The master engineering
plan, `AGENTS.md` doctrine, and the single-crate Rust 2024 (nightly) package with two
interchangeable binaries (`focr` and `franken_ocr`) over one shared `cli_main()`
entrypoint
([9b38939](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/9b38939)). A Source
and Oracle Truth Pack pinned and hashed the exact Baidu Unlimited-OCR source commits
and resolved all 18 open questions from pinned source before any forward code was
written
([3c18187](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/3c18187),
[2c337e3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/2c337e3)). Phase 0
added the architecture and parity docs, the real oracle harness, the dual-binary fix,
tokenizer conformance, the `.focrq` container spec, and the artifact ledgers
([bfa982b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/bfa982b)).

### Changed

- Source relicensed to the MIT License with an OpenAI/Anthropic Rider, Copyright (c)
  2026 Jeffrey Emanuel
  ([1e881a7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/1e881a7)). The
  Baidu Unlimited-OCR weights, and any quantized derivative this project distributes,
  remain under the MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 Baidu; that notice travels with any
  distributed weight artifact.
- Project status moved from "pre-Phase-0 scaffold that does not run yet" to a working,
  measured engine. The `ocr`, `convert`, and `pull` paths run for real; `runs`,
  `sync`, and `doctor` remain explicit scaffolds (see Known limitations).
- Version set to 0.1.0 for the first release
  ([a862cf3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/a862cf3)).

### Fixed

- A hardening pass cleared 11 runtime test failures across five subsystems, taking the
  library suite to a green bar
  ([266a5fe](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/266a5fe)), and a
  `clippy -D warnings` sweep brought `--all-targets` to green
  ([a6438e6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/a6438e6)).
- Forward kernels were hardened against malformed tensors: overflow-guarded igemm and
  int4/int8 unpack shapes, shape-arithmetic checks before allocation across the SAM,
  CLIP, MoE, and decoder paths, and rejection of non-finite MoE router and preprocess
  inputs
  ([a05ddaa](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/a05ddaa),
  [77ac01d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/77ac01d),
  [34bc30a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/34bc30a)).
- Robot streams now emit `run_start` before any `run_error`
  ([7a81aa3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/7a81aa3)), the
  SAM/CLIP SIMD tiers are reported correctly by `robot backends`
  ([49156af](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/49156af)), and the
  i8mm SMMLA tier string was split from plain SDOT dotprod
  ([b8bae61](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/b8bae61)).
- Preprocessing matches Pillow's pad rounding and rejects grid overflow
  ([e1a91be](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/e1a91be)).

### Known limitations and negative evidence

- **int8 on hard dense tables.** int8 decode is byte-identical to f32 on easy pages,
  but on some dense tables it can trigger repetition runs (for example `page_0590`,
  tracked as `bd-ic8`) where f32 stays clean. The int8 decode path is behind a kill
  switch.
- **Vision int8 is not viable.** Quantizing the vision tower breaks OCR accuracy
  (measured CER about 0.37), so the tower is kept high precision. This is recorded
  negative evidence, not a retry candidate.
- **int4 is not shipped.** int8 is the only validated quant in 0.1.0. An int4-via-unpack
  `lm_head` path *regressed* by roughly 5.8x: the `s4s8` kernel unpacks nibbles to an int8
  buffer in memory before the dot product, adding memory traffic, so int4 was shelved on
  perf grounds; `focr convert` accepts only int8
  ([4370c15](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_ocr/commit/4370c15)).
- **No native Windows binary.** Under WSL the Linux path applies; native Git-Bash, MSYS,
  or Cygwin are not supported targets (epic `bd-3u97`).
- **Image input only.** PDFs are rasterized out of band.
- **Scaffold surfaces.** `runs`, `sync export-jsonl`, `sync import-jsonl`, and `doctor`
  emit structured JSON but return not-implemented (exit code 1) in this release.

### Methodology and evidence

The forward path was built code-first against a Baidu reference oracle, then proven
stage by stage: vision and projector at cosine 0.9996, decoder and `lm_head`
argmax-exact, and the full `focr ocr` pipeline argmax-exact, with a final
character-error-rate of 0.0094 on a real page against the reference. Every perf and
quant lever carries a parity gate and an honest ledger entry, including the negative
results above. The `.focrq` byte-parity, the SHA256 manifest verification in
`focr pull`, and the 24/24 `robot selftest` (including the K=6848 overflow case) were
all verified on real hardware on Apple Silicon and on a real x86 AVX2 host.
