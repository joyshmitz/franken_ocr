//! `franken_ocr` — a pure-Rust, CPU-hyper-optimized runner for the Baidu

//!
//! See [`COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_FRANKEN_OCR.md`] for the master plan and
//! `AGENTS.md` for the engineering doctrine. The public surface is the

//! heavy model forward, the model-specific int8/int4 kernels, and the weight

//! (preprocess → vision → connector → decoder → sampler → postprocess) over the
//! [`native_engine`] modules; stages whose `.focrq` tensor accessors are not yet
//! built surface a clean [`FocrError::NotImplemented`] rather than fabricating
//! output (doctrine #1).
