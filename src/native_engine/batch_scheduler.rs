//! bd-1azu.8 — continuous-batch decode scheduler (Lever-A keystone).
//!
//! The single sequential driver for the Phase-6 throughput spine. It holds up
//! to `B` in-flight [`PageStream`]s and, at every step, gathers EVERY active
//! stream's current decode hidden into ONE batched forward (composing the
//! Wave-1 batched kernels: [`super::decoder::batched_lm_head_i8`] →
//! [`super::sampler::batched_decode_step`] → [`super::decoder::batched_decode_step_i8`]).
//! Streams that hit EOS / `max_length` retire and are backfilled from a pending
//! queue so the active set stays saturated; outputs are RE-SORTED to input
//! order via [`PageStream::input_index`].
//!
//! ## Doctrine #5 (the heart)
//! The scheduler is the SINGLE sequential driver — at every step EXACTLY ONE
//! batched forward is live over the active streams (NOT `N` nested forwards).
//! It instruments [`SchedulerStats::max_concurrent_forwards`] (must stay `1`)
//! and [`SchedulerStats::guard_held_during_fanout`] (must stay `false`) so the
//! bd-1azu.14 watchdog gate can assert the one-live-forward / no-lock-held-during
//! -fan-out invariants. The model-cache `Mutex` is acquired ONCE and its guard
//! dropped before any fan-out — that wiring lives in the CLI driver (bd-1azu.11);
//! this module exposes the instrumentation hooks it reports through.
//!
//! ## Losslessness & kill-switch
//! Each stream's emitted tokens are identical to running that page through the
//! sequential `generate_cached_i8` path (the int8 GEMM contraction is
//! `M`-independent and the f32 attention is per-stream, never key-batched — see
//! bd-1azu.3/.5/.6/.7). The master kill-switch `FOCR_BATCH_SPINE=0`
//! ([`spine_enabled`]) reproduces the sequential driver byte-for-byte; with the
//! spine off this module is never entered, so it changes no production output.
//!
//! ## Scope boundary
//! This bead delivers the scheduler skeleton + the lossless stream lifecycle
//! (admit/retire/backfill/re-sort/one-live-forward), proven unconditionally by
//! the [`BatchStep`]-injected unit tests below. Co-batched **chunked-prefill
//! admission** is bd-1azu.9 and the **`focr ocr-batch` CLI rewire + end-to-end
//! parity** is bd-1azu.11/.13; the production [`DecoderBatchStep`] composes the
//! real forward so the kernels are wired and type-checked, with its end-to-end
//! positional/KV correctness proven by the model-gated bd-1azu.13 gate.
